        My name is Jennifer Mazanec. I was born and raised in the Cleveland, Ohio area, although I did spend a few of my early years abroad. I attended the University of Notre Dame (Go Irish!) where I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology with a minor in Business Economics. I decided to pursue a career in Human Resources working for a retail company in their Learning and Development Department. 
        <br>
        <br>I soon realized this career path was not for me and started to think about what really interested and excited me (better late than never). I have always loved and had a knack for technology, and I found that I am most engaged in projects that have a technical component. This along with a desire for a creative aspect in my work prompted me to pursue web development. This brought me to the Case Western Reserve University Coding Boot Camp.
        <br>
        <br>In the rare moments when I am not absorbed in code, I enjoy reading and watching TV (nothing too serious &#9786;) and playing tennis. I love to travel and explore new places (even in my own backyard). I am an avid BuzzFeed follower and spend far too much time considering what my Chipotle order says about my personality. I also attempt to wrangle two very unruly dogs.
